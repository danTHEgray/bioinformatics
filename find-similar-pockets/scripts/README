#
##gen-pockets

#
##align-structures.py

#finds the longest axis in each pocket, passes this to align.tcl
#
##align.tcl

#does alignments for each pocket along the longest axis
#
##compare

#nitrogenase pocket. outputs scores to text file
#
##get-score-file.py
#
#integrates all scores into one file
